The dataset comprises 1,465 entries with 16 features, including product information, pricing, user reviews, and ratings. Each entry details attributes such as product ID, name, category, discounted and actual prices, discount percentage, rating and count, user details, and review content. After exploring the data along with some interesting analysis, I implemented a recommendation engine to enhance the user shopping experience by suggesting relevant products based on search words that match a productâ€™s description. This project showcases my expertise in data analysis, machine learning."

The dataset, as shown in the image, includes both numerical and categorical variables. Before building the regression model, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between some of these independent variables and the target variable. This step was crucial for effective feature engineering and selection, ensuring the model's accuracy and reliability."
